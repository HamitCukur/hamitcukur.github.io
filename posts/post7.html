      <p>let me guess - you checked your phone at least 10 times while reading this sentence. don't worry, i won't judge... much. üòè</p>

      <p>as an engineer who designs complex systems, i find it fascinating how we've become the most sophisticated machines ever designed... only to be defeated by notification dopamine hits.</p>

      <p>marcus aurelius never had to deal with instagram thirst traps or linkedin humble brags. lucky bastard. but his principles are more relevant now than ever:</p>

      <p>"very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking."</p>

      <p>spoiler alert: that 'very little' doesn't include your 47 daily tiktok dance videos.</p>

      <p>here's what your phone is actually doing to you:</p>

      <p>1. destroying your attention span<br>
         remember when you could read a book without checking twitter every 3 minutes? yeah, me neither.</p>

      <p>2. weakening your mental resilience<br>
         why solve a problem when you can scroll through memes about having problems?</p>

      <p>3. killing your creativity<br>
         leonardo da vinci didn't have netflix. just saying.</p>

      <p>the solution? i'm not suggesting you become a digital hermit (though that would make for an interesting linkedin post). instead:</p>

      <p>- set boundaries like they're restraining orders<br>
         - treat notifications like they're your clingy ex<br>
         - make your phone earn its place in your life</p>

      <p>remember: you're the descendant of warriors, philosophers, and innovators. act like it.</p>

      <p>now excuse me while i post this on my smartphone. oh, the irony... ü§î</p>
